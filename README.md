# Bradford-Calculato
## The Bradford calculator is a simple calculator that provides businesses with a score on each employee based on their unplanned absences. It was designed on the basis that repeat, short-term absence has a bigger impact on business operations, with a higher score representing an increased disruption for the organization.
